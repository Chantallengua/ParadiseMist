# ParadiseMist

Paradise Mist is a project made for the course 'Web Writing and Digital Storytelling', chaired by Prof. Francesca Tomasi and within the Master in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge at the University of Bologna. This project analyzes the traditional definitions of the story structure, from Syd Field's Three Acts to Christopher Vogler's "The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure for Writers", to create a mystery adventure video game designed for consoles and featuring a strong element of transmedia storyteling, in the form of an online ARG (Alternate Reality Game).
